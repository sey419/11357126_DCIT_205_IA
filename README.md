  This website is a website for the Computer Science Department of the University of Ghana. The website provides information about the department, its faculty, and its programmes. The website also showcases some of the short courses that the department offers to the general public.Before the website was created, I cloned the repository onto my local machine.In the terminal, git clone was keyed in and the code in the repository was copy pasted in the terminal.A folder then appeared in the code editor.Git add and the individuals file name  was used to track files. The git commit-m was used to send a message as to why the changes in the file was made. I then used the source remote on the code editor to push the change in the file.
